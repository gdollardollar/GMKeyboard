/// `minimumMargin` from the keyboard.
///
/// This is proposed as a way to better handle the safe areas.

    /// will move the `bottomView` upwards.

    /// This method is called to calculate the bottom constraint constant for

    /// The result is assigned to the keyboardConstraint?.constant in the

    /// new layout is requested.

    /// The default implementation does not make any assumption about min or max constraint constant. Instead, it
    /// will try to always compute a constant that places the `bottomView` at `keyboardMargin` from the keyboard's top.
    /// You should place additional constraints to prevent the view from moving in a non desired way.
